# Paging-Segmentation-Implementation

- Paging and segmentation both are the memory management schemes. 

- Paging allows the memory to be divided into fixed sized block whereas the segmentation, divides the memory space into segments of the variable block size.
 
- Where the paging leads to internal fragmentation the segmentation leads to external fragmentation.

- In this module we have implemented the visualization of the Paging and Segmentation scheme as done by an operating system. The program takes multiple processes and their required memory as input and outputs the visualization table.

- The files directory contains information about processes and their required memory. You can also input the process memory normally through the console by selecting the option of input method of console when the program opens.

- To run the code, just go to the folder and then give the command ./a.out.
